//------Notes-----//



//-----Known Issues of Instructions-----//
Most common problems occurred when a typo occurred in the 'String-based" switch loops.
	If such problems do occur, a System.out printout should occur during the loading, and
	changing of a valid component setting change (Ex. Checkbox being (un)selected).
Another issue that frequently happened, was in WindowBuilder, setting the "name" of the 
	component meant the variable's name of the component, rather then setting the "name setting"
	of the component.
